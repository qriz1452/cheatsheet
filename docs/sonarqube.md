# Sonarqube : 

SonarQube is a self-managed, automatic code review tool that systematically helps you deliver clean code. As a core element of our Sonar solution, SonarQube integrates into your existing workflow and detects issues in your code to help you perform continuous code inspections of your projects. The tool analyses 30+ different programming languages and integrates into your CI pipeline and DevOps platform to ensure that your code meets high-quality standards.

Writing clean code is essential to maintaining a healthy codebase. We define Clean Code as code that meets a certain defined standard, i.e. code that is reliable, secure, maintainable, readable, and modular, in addition to having other key attributes. This applies to all code: source code, test code, infrastructure as code, glue code, scripts, etc.

A quality gate is an indicator of code quality that can be configured to give a go/no-go signal on the current release-worthiness of the code. It indicates whether your code is clean and can move forward.

A passing (green) quality gate means the code meets your standard and is ready to be merged.
A failing (red) quality gate means there are issues to address.
